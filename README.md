# Movieland

With the over abundance of movies available to us at the click of our mouse, choosing what movie to
watch can feel overwhelming. One common way to narrow down movies is through movie rating. Movie
review sites such as IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and Letterboxd can be helpful in this discovery process.
However, Movieland aims to improve this process. Our project uses [Movie Industry](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies) by Daniel Grijalva to visaulize every movie and their ratings from the last decade (2011-2020). Rather than having users manually search up
individual movies to check their reviews, our data visualizations allow for more exploration. In other
words, users will be able to look at a large variety of movies and their ratings, and directly compare them
to others within and outside of their respective genres. Furthermore, there will be additional information
regarding actors and directors that allow an extra layer of filtering if need be.



This visualization was created for CPSV 436V 2021 W2 together by Jennifer L., Aaron Z., and Xinyu. L.
